# Oxygen

## Description
Oxygen is my first front-end website, created as part of a high school computer science course.  
The project was built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, focusing on interactivity, layout, and basic user experience design.

## What I Learned
- DOM manipulation and event handling with vanilla JavaScript  
- Structuring and styling a responsive front-end layout  
- Improving a project through iteration and user feedback  

## Documentation
- **Iterative Process PDF** – documents planning, development, and revisions  
- **UX Testing PDF** – summarizes feedback from 5 users and changes made  

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository  
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser

## Future Improvements
- Add more animations and interactivity  
- Improve mobile responsiveness  
- Refactor JavaScript for better organization
